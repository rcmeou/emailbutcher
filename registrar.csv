Notes: 123movies.com is based out of Vietnam, hosted out of the Ukraine, and re-hosted out of Vietnam using Cloudfare and cyberlockers to hide the identity of the operator. The issue is that they are just pushed to other sites or new sites which make it hard for us to keep up. The only thing is maybe see if you can’t get any data at all from the video stream. Most users have to pay via paypal or bitcoin so there may be tracking in small capacities there.

Notes:
Legal process should be addressed to “4chan Custodian of Records” and e-mailed to lawenforcement@4chan.org. We do not accept process via any other means at this time.
If your agency requires an address be listed on legal process, you may use:

ATTN: Custodian of Records
2885 Sanford Ave Sw #34441
Grandville Mi 49418-1342
PER 4CHAN:
Please be advised that 4chan, being an anonymous website, is unlike most websites in that we do not require users to make any sort of account before posting. Therefore we do not have the information typically associated with the traditional user accounts that most websites use, such as real names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, etc. Our records, when available, are typically limited to metadata and originating IPv4 addresses on a post-by-post basis. As such we rarely have any ability to notify our users of anything, and we do not attempt to do so in the event we are served legal process involving them
In order to locate any available records we require both the board name and post number(s) of the post(s) in question. The board name can be found either on the top of the page (e.g., /b/ – Random), or as part of the thread URL (e.g., https://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/7123456789). Post numbers can be found in the top right hand corner of each individual post, after the timestamp.
4chan retains few, if any, records about expired/pruned postings. Postings usually expire within hours to days at most, and we generally must receive a preservation order, emergency request, or other legal process within 12-24 hours of a posting being made in order to preserve or retrieve records prior to their expiration. Some exceptions exist however, including when a user has been blocked from posting, and/or when their posting(s) have been removed by a moderator.
If your investigation pertains to a NCMEC report submitted by 4chan, the NCMEC report likely contains all available information pertaining to the incident.

May 2024:
The correct email for them is law@adultsearch.com.  They do not require an MLAT and in fact state that they are not part of the Hague Convention since they are based in Angola, so traditional methods of service are not accepted.
This is directly from their site:
IMPORTANT:
We want to help.
If the matter is in regards to non-consensual activity or to do with a minor, you do not need a subpoena/warrant/court order etc. Simply send a request from your law enforcement email to  and we will respond with what information we can provide. Please include the exact link to the ad in question.
The company philosophy in this matter is that people who traffic or prey on other people (let alone minors) should be prosecuted, and we are happy to help law enforcement in any way we can in these cases.
Please include a link to the ad or ads in question. This will allow us to find the information and get back to you much faster. A link will look something like https://adultsearch.com/florida/miami/female-escorts/2617518. If you cannot enter long addresses like this in your form, you may instead include the ad ID. In the example link above, the ad ID would be 2617518 – that is, the numbers after the last slash, /.
If the only trace you have is a phone number, we will try to help you, but note that people change and erase their phone numbers. They also don’t always put them in their user profiles, and they type it in a mix of words and numbers to make it harder to search for. We try to respond to all law enforcement inquiries within 36 hours. If you don’t hear from us within 72 hours, please email again, as there may have been a human or anti-spam algorithm error.
Special note for American Law Enforcement We are frequently asked for a legal division and/or a physical address to send subpoenas to. These requests seem to be particular to American law enforcement protocols. We are not USA citizens. We do not have a physical address nor any systems inside the United States.
Subpoena Process
That being said, Adultsearch.com is based in the Republic of Angola. While we are willing to voluntarily work with law enforcement informally to provide them with information quickly and efficiently via e-mail, we do not accept foreign subpoenas directly, nor any service of process, from jurisdictions outside of Angola, nor in any language but Portuguese. We never accept ANY formal service of process via e-mail.
Please note that the Republic of Angola is not a party to the Hague Convention and as such, litigants from Hague signatory countries may not automatically serve process using traditional means.
If you are in North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Antarctica or Australia/Oceana, whether or not your country is a signatory to the Hague Convention, then you need to have a Letters Rogatory prepared in both your native language and in Portuguese (along with a an affidavit signed before a notary by your translator), then signed by a judge in your jurisdiction, and forwarded to your state department. Your state department then needs to forward the Letters Rogatory to the state department of the Republic of Angola, based in Luanda, while adhering to strict formal diplomatic protocol, so that it may be forwarded to the state department of the Republic of Angola, and served in accordance with Angolan law. You should check with the state department of your individual country for confirmation of its processes. Please note that the time frame is generally 12-24 months (depending on the state departments and the current diplomatic relations with the Republic of Angola), and we would prefer to receive notice via the email address listed supra, so that we can help you quickly and effectively stop any illegal activity, as we don’t want any illegal activity happening on our site.
SUMMARY
We want to help you. You don’t need a subpoena / court order if your inquiry involves a minor.
Please include a link to the ads in question.
A link looks like this. https://adultsearch.com/florida/miami/female-escorts/2617518
If you can’t fit the link on your form, please give us the “ad id”, the last 7 digits of the link: 2617518
Links/ad ids are much better than just phone numbers
If you are sending a scanned order, please attach a plain text copy of the order (put in the email text itself), or a .doc format of the order. This will allow us to copy ad past the links/ad ids into our system to look up your request.

Notes:
Phone contact for safety and fleet Operations is 402-781-4817.
ALLO Communications utilizes NAT Porting technology. The IP provided in the subpoena request is part of our Network Address Translation (NAT) DHCP pool. NAT is a technology that allows us to reduce the number of public IPs in use on our network by assigning multiple customers a single IP address, but then appending a port number to differentiate specific subscribers. In order to identify the specific subscriber generating the traffic in question in the subpoena request we will also need either the NAT port number or the destination IP.
If providing the NAT port number: Typically the IPs from the NAT DHCP pool will typically have a 4 to 8 digit port number that follows the IP separated by a colon. So in this case it would appear 104.218.71.15:xxxx with X being the numerals of the port number.
If providing the destination IP: This would be the IP that ALLO’s customer was attempting to reach.

Pango provides a virtual private network (VPN) service. The IP address you identified appears to have been assigned to and used by Pango’s VPN servers. The IP addresses of our VPN servers do not relate to a single end user of our service. Such IP addresses are not assigned to our end users in the same way that an internet service provider (ISP) may assign IP addresses to its customers. Our VPN servers are used in connection with Pango’s, or a Pango partner’s, VPN products, and each server typically serves multiple end users simultaneously. Those products are intended to provide the security of a VPN to their users and thereby prevent snoopers, hackers, and other malicious actors from viewing whatever a user sends over a wireless network. They also help to maintain anonymity, and protect the privacy of the user. This means that our VPN products, by design, log very limited information about users. Pango does not log information that identifies which users were using which particular VPN servers at any given time based on the type of IP addresses provided, nor does Pango keep logs that associate the actual IP addresses of users with specific VPN servers. Furthermore, Pango does not log what users do over a VPN connection in any way that can be tied back to an individual user, and does not require users to identify themselves (such as by provision of a name or email address) to Pango in order to use its VPN services. Please note that it is possible that many thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of Pango and its partners’ hundreds of millions of users could have accessed the VPN server associated with the IP addresses provided. Therefore, we are unable to pinpoint specific users with respect to a VPN server’s IP address. It would also be extremely onerous and overbroad to produce all records associated with the IP address of one of Pango’s VPN servers, as this would require massive collection of data, and such a request would implicate thousands or millions of irrelevant records. Pango is committed to providing our users with a private and secure computing environment but has no desire for its products to be used for criminal purposes. We try to provide help where we can, but unfortunately in this situation, we are unlikely to be able to. Please send any questions you may have to legal-process@pango.co. 2019-01-15: “Please be informed that we do not keep logs on end users. For any legal inquiries please provide us with the subpoena at the listed address.""

Email: subpoenas@athenabitcoin.com
Notes:
Please note that we can provide captured PII and a full transaction history for the user or customer of the Athena Bitcoin kiosk.
However, we often receive requests for information about the recipient of the bitcoin purchased by one of our customers, which can be the customer, themselves, or an unknown third party. Please be aware that Athena Bitcoin has no information about the recipient or destination of the bitcoin purchased beyond the Bitcoin address that was provided by the customer to the Athena kiosk (and printed on our receipts).
Because Bitcoin addresses are long, random numbers that can be generated by the thousands on any mobile phone or PC, there is no PII associated with a Bitcoin address upon creation. However, transactions involving an address can be traced and downstream recipients potentially identified using specialized services, such as CipherTrace, Elliptic, and Chainalysis.
If you have any questions about the above or if we can be of further service, please reply here and include our Chief Compliance Officer and Regulatory Counsel, Sam Nazzaro.

Instead, Bitso’s productions of documents or other information for matters in the U.S. must be made pursuant to the appropriate Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT). This policy is consistent with U.S. and international law.

Any request must specify the date range the target(s) used the Burner app. We are unable to appropriately query our systems for responsive records without a date range.

The Clearing House Payments Company L.L.C. (“TCH”) operates the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (“CHIPS”), a funds-transfer (“wire”) system. The Clearing House is not a bank and does not hold accounts. As a funds-transfer system, CHIPS processes and settles “payment messages”, which are an instruction from a sending bank to a receiving bank to pay (or cause another bank to pay) a specified sum of money to a beneficiary. A CHIPS payment message is typically one transaction within a series of transactions (together the series of transactions is a “funds transfer”) between banks made for the purpose of making a payment from an originator to a beneficiary. All CHIPS payment messages are denominated in U.S. dollars.

Oct 2024: Comcast no longer doing records certifications
Per Comcast, they will be including a statement verifying the records in their returns, but will not be issuing certificates of regularly conducted business, absent a court order. They will provide a witness as needed.
Comcast now includes the following verbage:
The records attached hereto were made at or near the time by — or from information transmitted by — someone with knowledge of the matter, were kept in the course of regularly conducted business activity, and such records are maintained as a regular practice.
*** We are excited to launch our new LEA Portal effective April 3, 2023 ***
The new Portal has been redesigned to deliver a better experience based on input from our users and will provide enhanced security features to protect your information.
Each user will be required to re-register and use the new portal for all future submissions.
For submitting new requests and to register for the new LE Portal, visit this link:  https://lrc.comcast.com/lea
As always, we stand by to provide excellent customer support and our Operations team is available to assist you with any issues and answer any questions. They are available Monday through Friday, 8:30 am – 5:00 pm EST and may be reached at 866.947.8572.
Note: Tickets on the previous Portal will remain available to be viewed 14 days after receipt of your response.
NOTE: Comcast only retain IP Address info for 180 days.
Emergency Disclosure: 877-249-7306
After Hours Emergency: If you are a law enforcement agent seeking immediate assistance due to imminent loss of life or serious bodily injury, please contact the Comcast Security Response Center (24×7) 877-249-7306
Nov 2022: Comcast requires all legal process to be served via their LE Portal.
Effective June 27, 2018, we will be launching the Comcast Law Enforcement Portal. The portal is essentially a one stop shop for you to submit, track and download your Lawful orders.
To register for the Comcast LE Portal:
https://lrc.comcast.com/lea
(Registration is required to use the Portal).
. In the event someone tries to use the portal and the fill-able blanks aren’t populating, there are a few fixes for this. 1) The portal prefers Google Chrome, but it will work with Mozilla Firefox. 2) If both browsers will not populate the fill-able blanks, press the F5 key and that should clear your cache. This usually fixes the issue.
I am hopeful you will find the Portal easy and intuitive but if you have any questions about registering or using the portal, please feel free to call us at 866-947-8572. Of course, faxes will still be accepted at 866-947-5587.
**Be aware, responses uploaded by Comcast only lasts for 10 calendar days.(but can be re-uploaded upon request)
Update on Xfinity Mobile (XM)
As Xfinity Mobile continues to grow subscribers, so has the volume of Lawful orders associated with our product. Based on direct feedback we have received, I wanted to clarify the CALEA responsibilities associated with XM. Xfinity Mobile is a Comcast branded wireless product provisioned on the Verizon Wireless network. XM currently requires the user to be a Xfinity subscriber with a valid high speed internet account. Comcast owns the XM subscriber relationship and maintains all of the customer billing information (name, address, device) and call detail records. Since the XM customer is provisioned on the VZW Network, they maintain CALEA responsibility for surveillance, SMS, video, images and geolocation (pinging) services.
A Neustar search for an XM number will return “CELLCO PARTNERSHIP DBA – VERIZON WIRELESS – PA” as the operating company. Service of subpoena to VZW for subscriber information on a number belonging to XM will require another subpoena to Comcast; VZW does NOT have any subscriber information. Likewise, we (Comcast) will direct you to VZW for any surveillance or geolocation support. This service has many nuances so we highly recommend you contact us at 866-947-8LRC if you have any questions.

IP Identification Requirements:
Xfinity Wi-Fi Only:
Comcast provides Wi-Fi access (Xfinity Wi-Fi) to all Comcast internet subscribers and others who provide the required authentication credentials. The Comcast Legal Response Center will require source port information in order to identify a specific user of an Xfinity Wi-Fi IP address provisioned with an IPv4 address. Example 73.1.2.3:12345, where “12345” (the number after the colon) represents the assigned source port.
Residential / Commercial IP Addressing:
Residential, commercial and small business customers who subscribe to Comcast’s internet services receive dynamic and static IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses and do NOT require port information to identify a subscriber.
Note: A date and time of incident is required for each request noted above.
“Before sending a request, please confirm that the IP address is assigned to Comcast. This can be accomplished by visiting https://whois.arin.net/ui or https://www.ip2location.com/free.asp and inputting the IP address. Please also be aware that Comcast now uses Carrier Grade Natting (“CGN”) for Wi-Fi in place of IPv6 identification for all entities that are not yet IPv6 capable. Thus we will need the port number of the IP address from law enforcement to have full identification capability.” – Comcast LE Handbook

Notes: Confide is an app that allows users end-to-end encryption communication. Messages delete from server and phone upon reading the message. “Confide is not only end-to-end encrypted but also ephemeral. As such, all Confide messages and substantially all data disappear after a message is read - both from our servers as well as from the device. The data we retain is principally around account creation (user name, email address and/or phone number used to sign up for the account, when the account was created), assuming the user hasn't deleted the account. There is no retention period on deleted accounts. Further, if an account has been deleted we have no record of it ever having existed.

Emergency Requests form Law Enforcement:
For exigent circumstances involving an imminent threat to life or serious bodily injury to an Optimum or Lightpath subscriber; Law Enforcement may contact Altice USA (24 hours a day) directly at 877-438-7557Cablevision, Subpoena Compliance Group Fax: 516-803-2990.
July 2022: Please be advised that our normal processing time barring exigent circumstances is 21 days. This is for subscriber and log data. You should note that requests for billing/payment information do not fall into that category. This is due to the fact that our analysts do not have direct access to pull this data. They must request the data from the Billing and Payment Departments which can oftentimes take as much as 2-3 months to receive.
Legal process containing 5 or more targets is deemed a mass request and is produced with a fee assessment. There is no charge for the first target ID, but each subsequent target ID is $50/target.  We will invoice for any production that meets or exceeds this threshold and request that you provide billing information for your department if your legal process fits into this category.
Additionally we will invoice for expedited processing.  This is defined as any request for data requiring less than 21 days of normal processing time.  The fee is $100 for the first target and $25 for each additional target.  Please provide billing information for your department for this purpose as well should this apply to your request.

  eBay, Inc’s Online Law Enforcement portal can be accessed through the eBay LE eRequest system:
https://le.corp.ebay.com/leportal_communitieslogin
eBay Inc. is being separated into two independent publicly traded companies: eBay Inc. and PayPal Holdings, Inc.
As a result of this separation, there will be two separate Global Asset Protection teams supporting the new eBay and PayPal businesses, each of which will have a system that allows Law Enforcement to request user data consistent with the current robust and seamless processes already utilized by our global partners.
As of July 1, 2015, the current Law Enforcement eRequest System will be modified to ask submitters to choose either eBay or PayPal depending on which company you would like to request records for. By clicking on the appropriate company, you will be automatically re-directed to one of our company specific Law Enforcement Tools:
eBay Inc. – Law Enforcement eRequest System
PayPal Holdings, Inc. – Safety Hub – PayPal Law Enforcement Tool
Going forward, and as part of the company separation, you will need to provide two separate user data requests through each of the individual portals listed above. For eBay records your request must be addressed to eBay Inc. and our service level for return of records will be 20 business days. For PayPal records, your request must be addressed to PayPal Holdings, Inc. and our service level will be 10 business days.
In order to transition smoothly, the LERS site may temporarily go offline for 48 to 72 hours.
If you have any questions related to eBay, Inc. GAP team, please contact lawenforcement@ebay.com and if you have questions regarding the PayPal Holdings, Inc. GAP team please contact lawenforcement@paypal.com.
We look forward to maintaining our transparent, productive, and collaborative relationship with the law enforcement community as we complete this transition.

Notes: Send Subpoenas via Fax to Legal Compliance Team. We require a US jurisdiction subpoena or court order to turn over customer information to law enforcement. As a matter of course, we retain since 2008, customer name, company, address, e-mail, payment method and what services they purchased. We can usually look up an IP address allocation back a year, often much longer. Please note that because our customer interaction in almost entirely online and our services are delivered almost exclusively online, there are instances in which we do not have information beyond a name and PayPal e-mail address. Generally, however, we do have more complete customer information. EGI Hosting wholesales and provides collocation space, bandwidth and thousands of IPs to ISP/ESP reseller products (e.g., VPN’s, Proxies, Clouds, etc.) but does not manage the servers or their content. They will identify the reseller in their subpoena reply so that law enforcement can query that entity for subscriber information. EGI Hosting does NOT notify the subscriber/reseller that they have been served with legal process.

We will respond to the subpoena via E-MAIL with an encrypted WinZip file containing data in a Microsoft Access database. Please note you will need to have WinZip on your device to access the Fedwire information. Upon entering the Microsoft Access database please select either the “View Wires” or “View Wires in Table Format” buttons to analyze your production. Please do not select “Get Data.” Per our security procedure, we will release this password only to the individuals listed on the subpoena at the phone numbers provided. 8. The New York Fed does not currently charge for the production of information relating to funds transfers processed through the Fedwire Funds Service in response to a subpoena. Therefore, it is not necessary to attach billing or payment forms to the subpoena.

Data retention:
They advised that their system holds logs/data up to 2TB then it autodeletes. They stated that it depends on how much data they receive that day/week/month that determines how fast their system fills up. Therefore they could not give me a timeframe for retention as once again they are sized based.
You can email rcoffey@fireflyva.com, prior to submitting the subpoena to check if they still have data.
If data is for an IPv4, they require the timestamp, IP address, source port and a destination IP (server).

Submit your legal requests through the Law Enforcement Request System (LERS). The system requires each user to register for a unique account to submit legal requests. Register for an account at https://support.google.com/legal-investigations/contact/LERS
Emergency Disclosure Request (EDR) :
To submit an Emergency Disclosure Request (EDR) regarding a situation involving imminent danger of death or serious physical injury and the normal disclosure process is insufficient to address the threat, please download this form<https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/pJjLGuwauY5YJXwHdwapvOmF4NfimlE2QYzk>, fill it out completely, have it signed by a sworn government official, and submit it via your Law Enforcement Request System (LERS) account. If you do not have a LERS account or are experiencing issues submitting via LERS, email the form to emergencyrecords@google.com<mailto:emergencyrecords@google.com>.
When applicable, please provide us with evidence of the threat, such as a live YouTube or Blogger URL, or a copy of a Gmail message with full message headers<https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436>. This information is important in helping us determine if the threat at issue actually originated from the requested account. If the Google Account sought was identified by a third-party provider, provide a copy of the production from the provider or include a list of other identifiers (name, phone number, IP address, etc.) Many providers utilize unverified email addresses, and therefore this other information will assist in processing your EDR.
If you are submitting this form outside of normal business hours (9am-5pm CST Monday through Friday) and you have not already spoken to Google Legal Support regarding this matter, you may call +1-650-417-9011 and leave a message, as submissions are only reviewed during normal business hours. Further information regarding EDRs can be found at g.co/emergencylegalhelp<https://g.co/emergencylegalhelp>.

Notes: GB Holdings, Inc. stores all records electronically in our database servers, and electronically is the only form in which they exist. They maintain no paper copies, so the requested information is provided on Microsoft Access 2007 format. GunBroker.com is an online auction site similar to eBay. We function as an advertising venue much like the classified ads in a newspaper. As such, we only know that the item was listed by one person and bid on and won by another. We do not know whether the winning bidder paid the seller for the item, nor whether the winning bidder received the item from the seller. GunBroker.com does not verify the registration information provided by the user. The names, addresses, and phone numbers provided may or may not be accurate. Because of the above, GunBroker.com has no first-hand knowledge of whether or not money or any item changed hands, nor can we attest that the persons involved are who they claimed to be in their registration data.

Notes:
With respect to emergency requests, if you think there is a true emergency involving threats to the school, please complete and send in the attached emergency disclosure form. When we review the form, and verify your identity, we will determine if we believe this qualifies for emergency disclosures.
If there is no threat of imminent harm, we do not accept service of out of state process. We only accept valid subpoenas issued in Illinois where we are subject to jurisdiction.
Sincerely,
Basecamp Legal Team
  Emergency Disclosure Request Form for Law Enforcement
Please provide the information requested below in order to assist us in exercising our discretion to disclose under the standard stated in 18 USC § 2702(b)(8) and § 2702(c)(4) and/or to make voluntary disclosures of information outside the scope of either statute.[1]  Please email this form to legalrequests@basecamp.com with the subject line: Emergency Disclosure Request.
What is the nature of the emergency involving death or serious physical injury?
Whose death or serious physical injury is threatened?
Why is this situation an emergency such that normal disclosure processes would be insufficient or not timely? Is there reason to believe the threat is imminent?  Please provide information that suggests that there is a specific deadline before which it is necessary to receive the requested information (e.g., the threatened act will take place tomorrow before 5 pm).
What specific information do you believe is in our possession related to the emergency? Please make your request as narrow as possible; requesting all information about an account will delay the processing of your request.
Please explain how the information you are requesting will assist in averting the threatened emergency.

In order to comply with our privacy policy and assist you in your investigation, we require the following information;
Source Port (for IPv4):
Note 1: A large section of our IPv4 network utilizes Network Address Translation. At any point in time more than 200 users are sharing the same IP address. In order to narrow the search down to one specific user, we would need the SOURCE PORT used to connect from our network to the destination network. Please include the source port in your request.
Note 2: If you are unable to provide the source port, please provide multiple IP addresses/time/dates. This can help to narrow down the search to a specific user.
We also need Date, Time and Time Zone.
Please provide this information in a format that can be copy and pasted (CSV/TXT file or PDF files that allow copy and paste of the content). Please note that images and PDF files in image format do not provide copy-paste capability. This makes the process prone to human error, especially when a number of addresses/dates/times are provided.
Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. If you have any questions or require further information, please  do not hesitate to contact us.

The legal name is Huobi Global Limited. The registered address is Suite 202, 2nd Floor, Eden Plaza, Eden Island, Mahe, Seychelles.
The following is a response from Huobi’s legal representative in the US:
“Thank you for contacting us. This firm acts as counsel for Huobi Global Limited (“Huobi Global”) on specific matters for which we are engaged including the referenced request. Huobi Global has no U.S. presence or activities (among other things, U.S. users are prohibited), and consequently it is not subject to the jurisdiction of U.S. state or federal courts or regulatory agencies.
That said, in my experience, Huobi Global generally attempts to cooperate with these types of requests where it is not precluded from doing so under other applicable law.
I would suggest that you email us a formal written request on agency letterhead. (It can, but need not, be in the form of a subpoena). The client kindly requests that any identifiers listed in the subpoena or letter be provided separately in a word/excel file to prevent any copy/paste errors when working with pdfs. I will then forward these materials to our client for their attention, with the understanding that we are not authorized nor undertaking to accept service of the same on Huobi Global’s behalf, nor waiving any defenses or objections, including without limitation insufficient service or lack of jurisdiction.”

Our Law Enforcement Agency Support Guidelines are posted at https://www.sinch.com/legal/law-enforcement-support/
.
We provide wholesale communications interconnection services to other service providers.  Lacking a relationship with and information about the end user subscribers of our wholesale customers, our Guidelines must be reviewed in order to ensure submission of an appropriate subpoena/warrant/order (typically, seeking only customer identity; your agency can then pursue retail/end user details through our customer).  You may desire to register for our Law Enforcement Portal (see below), which provides on-screen the wholesale customer identity for a majority of target numbers queried (without need for a Legal Demand).
.
**TO SUBMIT SUBPOENAS / WARRANTS / ORDERS (“LEGAL DEMANDS”) — ONLY to LEArequests@sinch.com and per section 4.1 of our Guidelines (https://www.sinch.com/legal/law-enforcement-support/).  Our dedicated address LEArequests@sinch.com submits matters directly into our processing system.  Our system will return an auto-reply identifying our case no. (necessary for interaction) and providing other important processing information.  Check junk mail/spam filter if no auto-reply is received.  NEVER dually submit a paper copy unless required by your jurisdiction (if so, email first, and then send a copy of our auto-reply message along with your paper legal demand – this identifies our existing case to us).  NEVER submit number verification/confirmation requests (we cannot reply via email or phone; instead, register for our Portal — see below).  NEVER submit preservation requests (as a wholesale provider, we lack the records to be preserved; rather, submit a legal demand to us and then request preservation from our wholesale customer)
.
**COVER PAGE REQUIRED WITH ALL LEGAL DEMANDS:  as provided in section 4.1 of our Guidelines, fully complete our cover page form and attach it to your submitting email as a second separate file accompanying your legal demand.  Never handwrite, scan or combine the form with other documents into a consolidated file.  Matters lacking a cover page will be rejected (Cover Page Form is also posted at https://www.sinch.com/legal/law-enforcement-support/).
.
**EXIGENT CIRCUMSTANCES:  use ONLY web form located at https://www.sinch.com/legal/exigent-circumstances/.  Where submitting an exigent matter, please wait 15 minutes before calling.
.
**FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PORTAL:  Our Portal is NOT for submission of subpoenas/warrants/orders (“Legal Demands”), but it will avoid the need to submit most Legal Demands.  Our Portal is a resource for querying target numbers identified in an investigation as being in-service with us.  Our Portal provides customer identifying information about queried target phone numbers on an immediate, on-screen basis and without the need for service of a Legal Demand.  For Portal users, a Legal Demand is only necessary where a non-result is returned by our Portal (note:  our Portal only presently returns results for (1) active in-service numbers for which we have (2) the proactive consent of our wholesale customers for CPNI purposes).  The returned information identifies our then-current wholesale customer for the number and their contact details, and also specifies the in-service date for that party for the target number.  To register, see our website page (application form and user guide posted):  https://www.sinch.com/legal/lea-portal/.  Submit application to and request support via dedicated address LEAportal@sinch.com.  We welcome applications from LEA officers/agents, as well as attorneys and support staff who are otherwise involved in issuing and serving subpoenas, warrants and orders.

JC Penny’s only accepts service of legal process through one of their various registered agents.
In most states, the Secretary of State Office keeps a list of registered agents for companies registered to do business within the state.  In most states, we use CT Corporation, but that is not true for every state.  In larger states, we will have multiple addresses at which we can be served.  Again, it is best to check the Secretary of State’s records for each jurisdiction.
However, under no circumstances will we accept service of legal process via email.

Notes: Jitsi open source software is software that a user can install and manage on their own servers so 8x8 does not have any control over the actual operation of the user's application of the Jitsi software. It hosts an application of the Jitsi open source software - meet.jit.si - on its infrastructure, which allows users to hold free video meetings from their web browsers or via mobile application (iOS and Android). 1. You can send legal process for meet.jit.si to subpoena@8x8.com. 2. The subpoena team indicated that they do not have a phone number so you can send questions to subpoena@8x8.com or call the main 8x8 number (+1 408 727 1885). 3. Jitsi does not collect any contact information for meet.jit.si users so it has no means of contacting users. 4. The meet.jit.si privacy supplement (https://jitsi.org/meet-jit-si-privacy/) covers the user personal data that we process. Most personal data is only processed for the duration of the meeting. Once the last participant exits the meeting, it is deleted. The IP addresses of meeting participants and the originating telephone numbers if someone dials into the meeting instead of connecting through the Internet are exceptions. 5. The only information that persists on our servers beyond the meeting is IP address and originating telephone numbers if someone dials into the meeting. There is no requirement for the user to set up an account (or any option for them to do so) so we do not have usernames or contact information like email addresses for users.

Feb 2023:
The owners appeared to be housed in Iceland so I didn’t send them a search warrant/subpoena and just emailed that same “legal@leakedbb.com” email. I provided information regarding my investigation, and they were very responsive and removed the Victims content I requested. The moderators even flagged my Victims name/identifiers so no one could post on the site using content with her name or use her name in the title of their posts.

Notes:
LinkedIn Corporation has recently set-up a new portal using the product called Kodex for receiving data requests from law enforcement. We will no longer be accepting requests through email. Of note, this portal enables the submission of the request and the provision of responsive data using E2E 256-bit AES encryption. 
  Here is the link to the portal: https://app.kodex.us/linkedin/signin. 
More information about Kodex can be found here: https://www.kodex.us/. 
Linkedin advises that without a judge-signed order with specific instructions for nondisclosure, Linkedin’s policy is to notify the member (and send a copy) of the Request to the account holder whose data is being sought.
How Can Law Enforcement Officials Ask for Data? All requests must include the agent’s Badge/ID number, contact information, and must specify the member account by providing either (1) the full name of the member and email address associated with the account; or (2) the LinkedIn public profile URL. Data requests may be served by email: lera_ie@linkedin.com (EU) or lera_us@linkedin.com (all U.S. and non-EU), by fax to +1 650-810-2897, 353 (0)-1-633-5996 outside of the U.S., by certified mail, express courier, or in person at one of the following two locations below:

Except as required by law or in the event of utilizing a third party vendor that is prohibited from using personally identifiable information other than purposes for which their services are retained, Liquid Web will not release customer information or customer account information without the express consent of its customers. A valid subpoena, court order, or warrant is required for the identity or account information of a Liquid Web customer. Criminal matter subpoenas must be made by law enforcement. Unless prohibited by law, court order, or exceptional circumstances such as an emergency involving the risk of death or tampering with evidence, upon receipt of a valid civil subpoena, Liquid Web will notify its customer whose information is being sought and provide the customer with an opportunity to object/quash such request. If an objection is not received within fourteen (14) business days, Liquid Web will then provide the requested information. Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain a proper court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited. Liquid Web reserves the right to seek reimbursement for the costs in connection with responding to a subpoena. Payment must be made prior to Liquid Web providing the requested information. The costs are $5.00 for mail delivery charges and $0.25/page for copy charges. For more detailed requests, Liquid Web charges additional costs to comply but will provide you with the costs prior to processing such request. Liquid Web will respond to requests for customer information from foreign law enforcement agencies, however, such requests must be in English and must be issued via a court in the United States. All requests must be submitted in writing to: Attn Legal Team 2703 Ena Dr Lansing, Mi 48917 Or by email to legalrequests@liquidweb.com.

Law Enforcement Requests
To make a request, you will need a warrant issued by a UK authority in compliance with the UK Investigatory Powers Act of 2016 (“the Act”). We respond to requests from the United Kingdom only, in the form of authorisations which comply with article 66 of the aforementioned Act. Law enforcement agencies from outside the UK may obtain these types of authorisations through the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT).
These requests must be sent to abuse@matrix.org, and should include the following:
Details of the authorising officer, as per 61 (1) of the Act;
Details of the purpose for the request, as per 61 (7) of the Act.
We will only transfer information using end to end encryption.
  Emergency Requests from Government Agencies/Law Enforcement
We may disclose user information to government or law enforcement agencies – without a warrant – if we have a good faith belief that an emergency involving** imminent danger of death or serious physical injury** requires disclosure of information related to the emergency without delay.
Send your emergency request to abuse@matrix.org and include “emergency” in the subject line.
Include all information you have about the situation so that we may evaluate the urgency of your request, making sure that you indicate if the request is confidential.
Include the details of your agency, and your contact details.
If you make no mention of confidentiality, we will notify the user(s) affected.

Notes:
As part of our continuous effort to enhance service quality and efficiency, MediaLab is transitioning back to Zendesk, a trusted and user-centric customer service platform. This change takes effect immediately, and will aid in streamlining our interactions with law enforcement agencies.
Please be aware that while our Kodex portal will no longer accept new tickets, rest assured that any open tickets currently in the system will be completed to resolution. Our commitment to addressing your ongoing needs remains steadfast during this transition period.
We are eager to reinforce our partnership with your agency through this immediate transition to Zendesk. From this point forward, please ensure all legal orders are submitted directly through the Law Enforcement Request form here:
https://medialablawenforcementhelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us
Zendesk provides a straightforward and efficient system for submitting and tracking legal orders to MediaLab. This platform facilitates more effective communication and offers a clear view of your request statuses, moving us away from less efficient email exchanges.
It is important to note that legal orders sent outside of Zendesk will not be processed and must be resubmitted through the proper channel. We appreciate your cooperation during this change and are confident that this move will enhance our collaborative efforts.

We have received the facsimile of your subpoena. In the past we have
accepted subpoenas by fax, but upon consultation with legal counsel, we
believe we must require a small change in procedure. This better
protects Midcontinent’s and its customers’ interests in privacy and
complies with the law and Midcontinent’s applicable procedures. We ask
that you serve the subpoena upon Midcontinent in compliance with the
laws regarding subpoenas and the service of them. This means that we
would either request that the subpoena be provided to Midcontinent via
hand-delivery, as you would with subpoenas for other witnesses, or that
you provide us with an admission of service that we may execute and
return to you. This method of service would then comply with SDCL
15-6-45 & 15-6-4, SDCL Ch. 23A-14, Fed.R.Civ.P. 4 & 45, and
Fed.R.Crim.P. 17. If you disagree with this request, please let me know
of your disagreement and the grounds for that. Otherwise, please
consider this response to be an objection to producing the requested
information until service of the subpoena is completed in accord with
the applicable laws.

You may mail or serve Namecheap with a valid criminal or civil subpoena or U.S. Court Order by US mail or email.
Namecheap may, at its sole discretion, accept service by email.
Namecheap advises:
The IP login history is shown in EDT. However, email subscription through Namecheap (the section will be titled “Private Email Subscriptions”), is in UTC, and support tickets and chats are shown in UTC +2 (i.e., GMT +2).
Namecheap does not retain a customer’s credit card information. We use third party payment processors and for credit cards, we use Stripe.  Stripe should have the additional information that you are seeking. Our team believes that you will need to provide Stripe with the “CC Transaction ID,” which can be found in the “Transaction Review” section of the production. Other information like last four digits of the credit card and name on the card might be of help. This info is also available in the “Transaction Review” section.

Email: XRM-ussubpoenas@nortonlifelock.com
Website: https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/legal/us-subpoenas/
Notes: 1. Service of Law Enforcement Request via Email NortonLifeLock will accept service of valid non-testimonial subpoenas, search warrants and court orders for information (“Law Enforcement Request”) by email from law enforcement agencies, provided these are transmitted from an official email address of the law enforcement agency concerned. For testimonial subpoenas, please see Section II.B. below. Law enforcement officers submitting a Law Enforcement Request to NortonLifeLock should transmit it directly from their official law enforcement email address in PDF format to the U.S. Subpoenas mailbox, XRM-ussubpoenas@nortonlifelock.com. Again, the U.S. Subpoenas mailbox is intended solely for use by United States law enforcement and government agents. We require law enforcement to include the following information with the Law Enforcement Request so the request can be verified: o Law Enforcement agency o Name and badge/ID number of issuing agent/officer where applicable o Agency-issued email address o Law enforcement phone number (with extension if applicable) o Verifiable physical return address 2. Effective Date of Service, Acknowledgment of Receipt and Status Inquiries NortonLifeLock does not agree that service through this voluntary method is effective on the day the Law Enforcement Request is emailed to NortonLifeLock. Rather, service via email to the U.S. Subpoenas mailbox, XRM-ussubpoenas@nortonlifelock.com, will be deemed effective and complete on the day you receive an email acknowledgement of receipt from a member of NortonLifeLock’s Legal Department, which in general should be within 2-3 business days after submission of the Law Enforcement Request. If you have not received an email acknowledgement of receipt from NortonLifeLock’s Legal Department within 2-3 business days from the date the Law Enforcement Request was submitted, service of process should be effected through NortonLifeLock’s registered agent for service of process, Corporation Service Company (“CSC”). For other inquiries regarding the status of a specific subpoena, search warrant or court order, please do not contact the U.S. Subpoenas mailbox until at least 10 business days after your receipt of the email acknowledgement, unless the matter involves imminent harm or threat to life. When a Law Enforcement Request has been served on NortonLifeLock by email to the U.S. Subpoenas mailbox, and an email acknowledgement has been received, there is no need to serve duplicate process on NortonLifeLock by mail, through CSC or by other means. 3. In the case of exigent circumstances, as that term is defined in the applicable jurisdiction but generally understood to mean where there is a real and immediate threat of death or physical harm to an individual that NortonLifeLock may have information necessary to prevent, NortonLifeLock may voluntarily disclose information on an emergency basis. In order to request that NortonLifeLock do so, exigent requests from law enforcement agencies should use the process outlined above but the cover email should note “EXIGENT LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUEST” in the subject line. Failing to include that language in the subject line may lead to a delay in processing. Additionally, the cover email should include all relevant information to establish the nature of the exigent circumstances, the specific information sought necessary to help resolve the emergency, the best methods of communication with the requesting officer or agency (including after-hours contact information), contact information for the supervisor of the official making the request, and any other background information that may help NortonLifeLock facilitate the search for, and provision of, the requested information if appropriate. Should it decide to voluntarily provide information on an emergency basis, NortonLifeLock will respond to the request as quickly as practicable. *https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/legal/us-subpoenas/

Disposable Email Addresses: Information from representatives of Oath/Yahoo, via a trusted third party, that Yahoo email accounts containing a hyphen (example: name1-name2@yahoo.com) are disposable email addresses. Further, Oath/Yahoo advises that they cannot perform lookups based on disposable email addresses – such that if you submit legal process for name1-name2@yahoo.com, you may receive an answer that no such account exists. However, if you submit a subpoena with just the identifier before the hyphen (“name1”), which Yahoo refers to as the “basename”, Yahoo will be able to identify the associated non-disposable Yahoo account.

Notes: NOTE: Per Roberta Lynn from ooVoo, the company closed down last November 2017. They maintained records for six months, but are no longer available. Oovoo requests that all legal service be by email or registered mail. Faxes are not accepted. OoVoo will do everything we can to assist with your investigation. Please specify if your request is regarding ooVoo, Flinch or Heystax. We will honor a Preservation request for 90 days. Preservation blocks ooVoo from closing an account manually but does not block our automated profiling software from closing an account. Existing data to include: text messages, media sent/received, friend invitations and video call history is preserved. Preservation does not prevent a user from changing their profile photo or screen name, or unlinking their account from Facebook or Google mail. For account verification we require an ooVoo ID. We do not accept a display/screen name, telephone number or user’s name. ooVoo IDs are: one word with a minimum of 6 letters (alpha/numeric), no spaces or emoji’s. From the app, IDs are located on a user’s profile card and always visible. If you are submitting via a NCMEC Cybertipline report, the ‘Screen/User Name’ is the ooVoo ID. We will offer our best effort to confirm if you have an ooVoo ID prior to submitting your legal order. To release user data and login history, we require either a Subpoena, Court Order, Search Warrant or RIPA/DPR (UK). User content and media is available only with a Search Warrant (USA), Warrant (EU/AU/NZ) or notarized written consent from the user under investigation. With a Subpoena, Court Order, or RIPA (UK) our available user data includes: · Registration email address (not verified) · Login history with date & timestamp, available since 2014 · IP address history · Mac address & device name · Personal account information such as profile photo, display name, purchase history, Facebook email, or verified telephone number is provided as available. With a Search Warrant, Arrest Warrant (EU) or written consent from the user, the following additional data is available, in addition to the above data: · User content to include: text messages, media (photos or videos sent/received), video call history & friend invitations · User deleted history is also included · We will accept notarized written consent (UK: via official MLAT channels) with the user’s signature to give permission to release content. Compliance Requirements for your order: · We require a specific date range of user activity, strongly suggested to not request less than 2 days for best data. If you do not supply a date range, you will receive the last 1 week of data. · All legal orders are requested to be submitted via email. · All legal orders should be typed, including the contact and telephone number where someone can be reached, on your letterhead. · All ooVoo responses are sent via email. An email address must be included in your inquiry in order to receive our response. · We request the ooVoo IDs (not names) of the victim(s) under 13 years old. Being underage is also a violation of our terms of use; we require their IDs to close the loop of the investigation. Email all requests to: · Address: Krush Technologies LLC, 1700 S. Patterson Blvd, Suite 300; Dayton, OH 45409 · Attn: Roberta Lynn, ooVoo Privacy Officer & Law Enforcement Liaison · Email: law.enforcement@krush.com · Phone: 404-735-2129

Notes: PRIVATE TUNNEL LOGGING POLICY OpenVPN Inc. may retain or have access to the following data only; 1. Date, Time, Duration and amount of data used (Needed for billing purposes only) Available within past 60 days only due to data storage requirements in many countries. 2. Registered email addresses Note: We do not log browsing activity transmitted through VPN tunnels. WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU: 1) Email address to check on our system 2) If only IP/timestamps are available we need 4-5 incidents separated by at least 24 hours so we can distinguish the target user from others using the same IP address—our shared IP addresses can server hundreds of users. Sending detailed activity logs from webservers which include timestamps (with corresponding time zones), will help us connect the IP address to the suspected activity. 3) Provide any other known information on the suspect including email addresses, other IP addresses, known city or country of origin, credit card or other payment information. When only (1) IP / Time stamp: We have hundreds of users on an IP at any given time. What we can do with this single incident is to confirm that a particular suspect email was online on that IP at that time, if you can supply one or more emails, we can check and provide more information on said emails (check to be sure this doesn’t require a separate subpoena.) Otherwise, without additional IPs or additional timestamps at least 12 hours away from this one, we are unable to narrow it down to less than a few hundred users, which is probably not useful.

Pango Inc.,"Pango Inc.
Online Service: Pango Inc.
Email: legal-process@pango.co
Notes: ZG Subpoena Solutions provides law enforcement responses services to Pango Inc. and its affiliates (“Pango”), formerly known as AnchorFree Inc. Pango provides a virtual private network (VPN) service. The IP address you identified appears to have been assigned to and used by Pango’s VPN servers. The IP addresses of our VPN servers do not relate to a single end user of our service. Such IP addresses are not assigned to our end users in the same way that an internet service provider (ISP) may assign IP addresses to its customers. Our VPN servers are used in connection with Pango’s, or a Pango partner’s, VPN products, and each server typically serves multiple end users simultaneously. Those products are intended to provide the security of a VPN to their users and thereby prevent snoopers, hackers, and other malicious actors from viewing whatever a user sends over a wireless network. They also help to maintain anonymity, and protect the privacy of the user. This means that our VPN products, by design, log very limited information about users. Pango does not log information that identifies which users were using which particular VPN servers at any given time based on the type of IP addresses provided, nor does Pango keep logs that associate the actual IP addresses of users with specific VPN servers. Furthermore, Pango does not log what users do over a VPN connection in any way that can be tied back to an individual user, and does not require users to identify themselves (such as by provision of a name or email address) to Pango in order to use its VPN services. Please note that it is possible that many thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands, of Pango and its partners’ hundreds of millions of users could have accessed the VPN server associated with the IP addresses provided. Therefore, we are unable to pinpoint specific users with respect to a VPN server’s IP address. It would also be extremely onerous and overbroad to produce all records associated with the IP address of one of Pango’s VPN servers, as this would require massive collection of data, and such a request would implicate thousands or millions of irrelevant records. Pango is committed to providing our users with a private and secure computing environment but has no desire for its products to be used for criminal purposes. We try to provide help where we can, but unfortunately in this situation, we are unlikely to be able to. Please send any questions you may have to legal-process@pango.co.

Notes:
Aug 2024: Per Paxos:
Paxos will respond quickly to a hold harmless letter on agency letterhead, but they will not be able to provide KYC in most cases because they provide the structure for PayPal to receive crypto. Their response:
Due to the structure of our relationship with PayPal, we are not able to execute a freeze on this account and do not have any insight into end user information. We simply provide PayPal with the crypto infrastructure, while they conduct their own onboarding of their users and maintain their own AML/BSA/KYC programs. All PayPal user transactions that flow through Paxos are done under PayPal’s general omnibus account number, meaning we have no way to identify or segment transactional activity by unique user. When checking the transaction hash, we can only view the non-unique ID number assigned to all PayPal related transactions.

PayPal does NOT accept mailed or emailed subpoenas; they will not be processed. The Global Investigations team does not operate a fax machine.
Address subpoenas requesting specific products (e.g. Venmo, PayPal, Xoom) in the body of the subpoena, otherwise the response will only produce core PayPal account data. PayPal Credit subpoenas are generally handled by Synchrony (listed in Search.org under PayPal Credit) and should be sent to their office for processing. General data produced includes subscriber details, transaction details and account activity logon history (IP logs). Additional data such as underwriting or KYC documents will take longer to produce and are potentially burdensome to produce. Email lawenforcement@paypal.com if your investigation requires this data and you do not receive it in your subpoena response.
For general questions and inquiries, you can contact lawenforcement@paypal.com or visit https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/law-enforcement for specific guidelines and an FAQ document to help get you started.

We do not require any warrants to provide information, as we can disclose any data that you request provided that we continue correspondence through the official police email. Any legal process can be sent to our support email, help@peekaboo.fyi, or as a direct response to this email. From there, we can help with any inquiries.
Peekaboo users do not set up their accounts with email addresses, so we would not be able to find an account through an email address. We can attempt to find further details on an account with the exact name used in the app, the state the user is located in, and the user’s registered age in the app. It is especially helpful if we are provided screenshots of any profile about which information is requested.
The data that we retain on users is name, age, gender, and Snapchat username as entered in the app. We also possess IP addresses of users, which we then use to store city, region (state), and country, along with timestamp that the user was last online, the amount of times they were messaged, the amount of times they were seen in the app’s feed, their timezone, and any profile photos currently in use by the user. Our chat provider, Stream, may also retain some chat information, but we do not store this ourselves.

If a target number is assigned to a wholesale customer of ours, we are able to provide that wholesale customer’s legal compliance information without formal legal process.  This is a courtesy offered to law enforcement to save the time of the process of first serving QuestBlue when in fact such legal process will ultimately be served on our wholesale customer of record in order to obtain any and all end user information.  Our wholesale customer will make their own independent assessment of the request, including, without limitation, of any subpoena subsequently delivered.
PRIOR TO ANY FORMAL LEGAL SERVICE, MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE STRONGLY ENGOURAGED TO SEND AN EMAIL WITH THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION TO lawenforcement@questblue.com
FULL CONTACT INFORMATION, INCLUDING AGENCY NAME, ADDRESS, PHONE NUMBER, AND EMAIL ADDRESS*
THE TARGET TELEPHONE NUMBER IN THE XXX-XXX-XXXX FORMAT
SPECIFIC DATE(S) FOR WHICH INFORMATION IS BEIGN REQUESTED
*Please note: We require a response email address with all requests, including formal legal process. A reply may be rejected or delayed if not all information is provided. For service of legal process for non-civil matters: Email: lawenforcement@questblue.com (preferred method) QuestBlue

Email: legal.notices@quibi.com
Notes: Quibi (service that provides “movie-quality shows designed for your phone”) 1. You can send legal process to the following email address: legal.notices@quibi.com. Quibi reserves the right to require proper service but accepts legal process at that email address for its convenience and as a courtesy to law enforcement. 2. Given that Quibi’s employees are working from home under the stay-at-home orders, it does not have a general contact number for its legal process response team. The email address above is the best way to get in touch with it and it will do our best to respond timely. 3. Absent a non-disclosure order or other legal obligation, Quibi’s policy is to disclose service of legal process to the subscriber/user and to allow the subscriber/user time to challenge it if necessary. The exception is if, in Quibi’s discretion, there are compelling reasons not to disclose, such as if Quibi believes there would be risk of harm to others, risk of evidence destruction, or risk of fleeing. Quibi does not currently have a rule based on type of case, but instead assesses the circumstances and risks of each particular case. 4. Quibi’s data collection and storage practices are covered in its Privacy Policy, available at https://quibi.com/privacy-policy/, but what data is collected and stored about a particular individual may vary depending on things such as subscription state, which plan they chose, what device they are using, whether they have requested that we delete their data, and what they have opted in or out of. 5. Quibi requires an email address to be able to uniquely identify a user account. It does not collect or otherwise have usernames, physical addresses, phone numbers, or credit card numbers.

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.wrightflyer.le.reality&hl=en_US&gl=US
https://reality.app/
This application is an augmented reality “Gacha” chat application where participants have an animated avatar and have both text and voice chat capability. There is also video call capability.
Reality is an application run by “Gree, Inc.”:
https://corp.gree.net/jp/en/
I initially got into contact with Reality through their web contact portal:
https://help.le.wrightflyer.net/
I was contacted in response to my query if they would respond to a US search warrant. They requested the search warrant be sent as a PDF to info-gi-plc@ml.gree.net. For the actual warrant, the street address in Tokyo was found on Google Maps:
Roppongi Hills Gate Tower Residence, 6 Chome-11-1 Roppongi, Minato City, Tokyo 106-0032, Japan
We received results approximately 19 days after service.

Notes:
Response from Session:  Please note that Session is a private messaging app that was designed to protect human rights defenders and journalists. Due to the nature of Session’s decentralized technology, we are unable to provide any identifying data about Session users. The server infrastructure which processes messages for Session is decentralized and is not under any single party’s control. We do not have control, privileged access, or oversight over the routing or contents of messages over the network. As a result, we do not have the ability to tie Session IDs to real-life identities, access message contents, or access any associated metadata in relation to those conversations or users.
Therefore, we do not have the ability to link a specific Session ID or nickname to a device, IP number or other personal identification information. Also, it is not possible for us to preserve messages because the messages are stored encrypted on decentralized servers that we are not in control of.
As far as we understand, the only way to attain this information would be through physical access to the device used. The Google Play Store or Apple App Store may have data on the user(s) involved in your investigation. Google or Apple may be able to provide this information, although we do not have access to it ourselves, and will not be able to provide assistance.

After that screen is completed and submitted, an email is sent to the you which requires you to reply with supporting documentation for the request (preservation request, subpoena, search warrant, etc).
Each request should include the following information to assist with processing your request and reduce the chance of a rejection:
• 1. The name of the requesting body
• For example, the court that issued the subpoena, or government agency that authorized the request
• 2. The law or other authority that compels production
• 3. The Shopify entity from which you are requesting records
• Please see below for which entity controls the information you are seeking
• We cannot respond to requests directed to “Shopify” or “shopify.com” – you must specify one of our corporate entities
• 4. The subject of the request
• For example, an individual’s name, email, business name, or website address
• Shopify cannot identify individuals with a common name (e.g.: Jane Smith) without additional information
• Please do not provide us with an individual’s SSN/SIN, other government identification number, or a bank account number, or payment card number
• 5. The specific information requested
• See ‘What Types of Information does Shopify Control?’ section below
• 6. If the request must be kept secret, please: (1) enclose a non-disclosure or restraining order, or (2) identify the legal or regulatory basis for the requirement
• We will not notify the subject upon receipt of a Grand Jury Subpoena
• 7. If you require a Custodian of Records Affidavit or Certificate of True Copy, please let us know.
• 8. Deadlines for production, where relevant
• 9. Where Shopify should send the production
• For example, email address of the requester

Notes: From their website: https://skipthegames.com/contact Law enforcement inquiries: If the matter is in regards to non-consensual activity (or to do with a minor), you do not need a subpoena/warrant/court order etc. Simply send a request from your law enforcement email to abuse@skipthegames.com and we will respond with what information we can provide. Please include the exact link to the ad in question. The owner's personal philosophy in this matter is that people who traffic or prey on other people (let alone minors) should be shot, and we are happy to help law enforcement in any way we can in these cases. Please include a link to the ad or ads in question. This will allow us to find the information and get back to you much, much faster. A link will look something like https://lexington.skipthegames.com/female-escorts/caucasian_w/petite-busty-25-yr-old-dayton/5172697171234. If you cannot enter long addresses like this in your form, you may instead include the ad ID. In the example link above, the ad ID would be 5172697171234 - that is, the numbers after the last slash, /. If the only trace you have is a phone number, we will try to help you, but note that people change and erase their phone numbers. They also don't always put them in their user profiles, and they type it in a mix of words and numbers to make it harder to search for. We try to respond to all law enforcement inquiries within 36 hours. If you don't hear from us within 72 hours, please please email again, as there may have been a human or anti-spam algorithm error. If per your protocols you need to send an official subpoena, you may send scanned copies of papers to abuse@skipthegames.com Note for American law enforcement We are frequently asked for a legal division and/or a physical address to send subpoenas to. These requests seem to be particular to American law enforcement protocols. We do not have a physical address (nor any systems) inside the United States, nor (at this time) is it our procedure to travel to the United States to testify in any court proceedings. However, we are more than happy, if it is necessary for your case, to sign a ""Certificate of Authenticity of Business Records"" for you. We read all messages and do our best to respond within 2 hours. SUMMARY 1. We want to help you. You don't need a subpoena / court order if your inquiry involves a minor or non-consensual activity. 2. Please include a link to the ads in question. a. A link looks like https://lexington.skipthegames.com/female-escorts/caucasian_w/petite-busty-25-yr-old-dayton/5172697171234 b. If you can't fit the link on your form, please give us the ""ad id"", the last 12 digits of the link: 5172697171234 c. Links/ad ids are much better than just phone numbers 3. If you are sending a scanned order, please attach a plain text copy of the order (put in the email text itself), or a .doc format of the order. This will allow us to copy ad past the links/ad ids into our system to look up your request. 4. Please send to abuse@skipthegames.com Thank you for using Skipthegames.com

At this time, Snap’s Law Enforcement Service Site (“LESS”; less.snapchat.com) is available to select agencies and individuals.
U.S. law enforcement and governmental agencies should submit legal process and preservation requests to Snap via Snap’s Law Enforcement Service Site (“LESS”): less.snapchat.com.
Once there, an account can be created to submit new requests and to check the status of submissions.
We hope to make LESS available to additional agencies in the future. If are unable to utilize the LESS system, you can continue to submit legal process to lawenforcement@snapchat.com for our review and response.
Emergency Disclosure Requests:
U.S. and non-U.S. law enforcement ofﬁcials seeking the emergency disclosure of Snapchat account records should complete and submit Snap’s Law Enforcement Emergency Response Form via: https://less.snapchat.com/submit/edr.
For emergency law enforcement assistance, complete and submit the Law Enforcement Emergency Response Form:
https://lawenforcement.snapchat.com/emergency
Snapchat’s law enforcement guide is available at:

They also have a helpful safety center at: https://www.snapchat.com/safety
Note: Starting November 15, 2015, it will be Snapchat’s policy to notify its users when we receive legal process seeking their records, information, or content. Snapchat will recognize two exceptions to this policy. First, Snapchat will not notify users of legal process where providing notice is prohibited by a court order issued under 18 U.S.C. § 2705(b) or by other legal authority. Second, where Snapchat, in its sole discretion, believes an exceptional circumstance exists, such as cases involving child exploitation or the threat of imminent death or bodily injury, Snapchat reserves the right to forgo user notice.

Notes: Please note that our reports contain all data available to us. Serving search warrants or subpoenas will not yield any further information than what is available in the report itself. We are a small business that runs several real-time chat websites. These sites do not require registration in order to chat - therefore the information available to us is usually limited to an IP address and the username of the chatter. If the user has registered an account the report will also include an e-mail address. The reports originate with our volunteer team of moderators. We have developed an automated system that allows moderators to report illicit images that have been shared in chat to NCMEC. This was done in good faith as an effort to protect minors. We retain the images for at least 90 days. It's no problem for me to provide copies if needed, no need for paperwork once I've verified you're with law enforcement.

Notes:
Talking Parents is an online service used in many family courts to allow messages between multiple parties, often for child custody or divorce issues. The company maintains all messages and user are not able to delete any content. Users can directly provide a .pdf to law enforcement of all messages; however, users do not have access to IP address logs or other data outside of the message dates/times/content.
The company has a legal compliance division and does capture IP address information. The company reported to me on an active case I have that IP information can be obtained through subpoena which can be submitted via US mail. The company reports a $150 subpoena compliance fee.
Law Enforcement can contact the company’s attorney, Stephen Nixon, with additional questions at stephen@talkingparents.com

RE: Monitored Communications, LLC dba TalkingParents
2113 Lewis Turner Blvd #100
Fort Walton Beach, FL 32547
When asked the following questions:
what type of mobile device information is retained?
Mobile phone numbers are only if the information is provided by the parent/end-user. Otherwise, we may collect basic information such as device, browser, or app version based on sign-in or other activity the parent/end-user has taken within the TalkingParents service. However, we do not collect information that is as specific as IMEI numbers. An example of this information may look like:
Device: iPhone 12
OS Version: 17.5.1
Source: Mobile
Or
Browser: Mobile Safari
Device: iPhone
Source: Web
How long does talking parents retain IP address info?
We cannot estimate a timeframe based on various factors such as the length of records, the amount of activity within the timeframe, and searching for the parents’/end-user’s records. If it is determined that we will need to provide you with the requested information to comply with a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, our team will make it a priority and deliver the information in the timeliest manner possible. This is why we ask that the information you are requesting is clearly defined and includes the parents/end-user’s specific information.

For general law enforcement assistance email:

It appears the email address keeps changing back and forth over the years:
Jan 2024: Email: GSI.Subpoenas@td.com
Sept 2023: Email: AccountAMCBGSISubpoenas@td.com
May 2023:  Email: GSI.Subpoenas@td.com
Feb 2023:  Email: AccountAMCBGSISubpoenas@td.com
Notes: Send subpoenas to AccountAMCBGSISubpoenas@td.com.
– So it looks like AccountAMCBGSISubpoenas@td.com is an internal email address.  If you email it from an outside server it gets rejected.  But after my request was forwarded to gis.subpoenas@td.com the confirmation email came from the AccountAMCBGSISubpoenas@td.com one.

https://textplus.com/law-enforcement-form
If you are seeking registration records pertaining to a textPlus user, in accordance with the U.S. Stored Communications Act, please obtain a subpoena seeking disclosure of basic subscriber records pertaining to the textPlus phone number in question.
From there you can order a subpoena or search warrant and add them to your cart. Please note that we will not capture payment, or send the order invoice until after the results have been compiled and sent back to you.
textPlus seeks reimbursement for costs associated with information produced pursuant to legal process and as permitted by law (e.g., under 18 U.S.C. §2706)
Once you receive your purchase receipt with the order number, please forward the email with a signed copy of the Court Order that you obtained to lawenforcement@textplusteam.com that is addressed to Gogii Inc. or TextPlus and includes either a textPlus username (not the “nickname”, there are no spaces in the username), user email, or textPlus phone number. In the Court Order, please include your email address, and at least one specific date that the target has been known to use our phone number so that we can identify the correct user.
Our current turnaround time is within 15 days.
We also do not disclose any inquiries into our customer’s accounts.
Lastly, we currently archive all of our data going back to Oct/2015 so Preservation Orders are not necessary.

Email: Tom@tracki.com
Notes:
In order to obtain information about a Tracki or Trackimo GPS tracking device, you will need:
 – A Subpoena or Search Warrant signed by a lawful judge. We honor international legal inquiries. 
– The Device ID number – a 9-digit number located inside the device behind the battery. Removing the battery does not affect data retrieval because there is no useful data stored on the device. 
You MUST reference this 9-digit device number in the subpoena or search warrant. Tracki devices start with the digit ‘5’ or ‘6’. Trackimo devices start with ‘0’ – ‘4’. For example: 562000000 is Tracki. However, 362111111 is Trackimo. 
Send the subpoena/search warrant to this email address or Tom@tracki.com with subject line “Legal Request for [device ID#]”.
 Turnaround is about 3-5 business days. We will provide account information that is available at the time of your inquiry (subscriber email, name, phone number, tracking data/history, payment info., etc.) – but only the data that is specifically requested.
 We accept subpoenas ONLY VIA EMAIL. However, for your records, our legal process address is:

Email: Tom@tracki.com
Notes:
In order to obtain information about a Tracki or Trackimo GPS tracking device, you will need:
 – A Subpoena or Search Warrant signed by a lawful judge. We honor international legal inquiries.
 – The Device ID number – a 9-digit number located inside the device behind the battery. Removing the battery does not affect data retrieval because there is no useful data stored on the device.
 You MUST reference this 9-digit device number in the subpoena or search warrant. Tracki devices start with the digit ‘5’ or ‘6’. Trackimo devices start with ‘0’ – ‘4’. For example: 562000000 is Tracki. However, 362111111 is Trackimo.
 Send the subpoena/search warrant to this email address or Tom@tracki.com with subject line “Legal Request for [device ID#]”.
 Turnaround is about 3-5 business days. We will provide account information that is available at the time of your inquiry (subscriber email, name, phone number, tracking data/history, payment info., etc.) – but only the data that is specifically requested.
 We accept subpoenas ONLY VIA EMAIL. However, for your records, our legal process address is:

We will then verify your credentials and discuss the reason for your call. In some cases, we may require that a request be made in writing and will notify you at that time should this be the case. If you would like to request supporting documentation for a SAR filed by Truist, you may call the phone line and select Option 1, or you may email your request to:
FIU-LE.SARRequests@truist.com

Online Service: Uber Technologies, Inc.
Online Attn: ATTN: Law Enforcement Response Team
Address: 1725 3rd Street
City: San Francisco
State: CA
Zip Code: 94158
Notes:
Uber utilizes a LE Portal for all legal process:
Law Enforcement Portal: https://lert.uber.com
To submit a request to the Uber Law Enforcement Response Team (LERT), law enforcement should create an account and submit the request through the Law Enforcement Portal at https://lert.uber.com. The Portal is a central place for law enforcement to communicate securely with our LERT Specialists when submitting preservation requests or legal process, getting status updates on responses to legal process, receiving responsive information, and asking questions.
Preservation of Records:
Upon receipt of a formal written request we will work to preserve records in connection with official criminal investigations for 90 days. Law enforcement may extend a preservation request, once, for an additional 90 days. We do not maintain preserved materials unless we receive an extension request or legal process.
Legal Process Requirements:
We will provide responsive records in accordance with our terms, policies, and applicable law. Some general principles are set forth here, but may not apply in every case.
We require a subpoena issued in connection with an official criminal investigation to compel the disclosure of basic information. A search warrant issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures upon a showing of probable cause is required to compel our disclosure of certain communications between people using Uber or GPS location information. Exceptions to these requirements may be available for emergency and exigent requests, where a user has provided consent, or – for requests that do not require a warrant – where other legal or regulatory standards apply.
Emergency and Exigent Requests:
We have a process for evaluating requests on an emergency or exigent basis where there is an emergency or exigency that involves protecting a rider, driver-partner, or third party who has been physically harmed or stopping illegal activity that poses an immediate threat of physical harm, or in cases of verifiable time-sensitive investigations. Requestors must submit an Emergency Request through the Law Enforcement Portal at https://lert.uber.com. We require a description of the nature of the emergency or urgency, including details about the nature of the alleged actual or threatened physical harm or exigency, and we review these requests on a case-by-case basis. We may provide responsive information when we have a good faith belief that doing so may protect riders, driver-partners, others, Uber, or otherwise assist with an exigent investigation. Once the emergency or exigency has passed, we require law enforcement to follow up with the appropriate legal process and we may require law enforcement to obtain appropriate legal process for any initial or additional disclosure. To facilitate our review, law enforcement should provide as much detail about the incident or emergency as possible.
Form of Request:
Authorized law enforcement using an official government domain may create an account and submit legal process to Uber through the Law Enforcement Portal at https://lert.uber.com. We accept courtesy copies through the Law Enforcement Portal as a convenience, but reserve all rights and objections, such as for lack of jurisdiction or improper service.
Law enforcement should include in their request:
• Clear grounds for the legal basis for the request;
• Detailed specifics on the information sought. We will be unable to process overly broad or vague requests that do not identify the information sought with particularity; and
• The name of the issuing authority, badge/ID number of the responsible agent or officer, an email address from a law-enforcement domain, and a direct contact number.

Notes: We are happy to assist lawful investigations; however the request will need to be submitted within a Subpoena or Court Order. Please provide detailed and accurate information at the outset as this will facilitate efficient processing of your request. This information should include, for example, email address, Steam account name, credit card number tied to the account you wish to receive records for. Please note: -Steam account names are not visible to the public. If you are investigating an account from our community you are viewing their persona name. Persona names are not unique, can be the same on multiple accounts, and can be changed anytime. Please provide either the 15-17 digit number included in the address link or the entire link for the profile you are viewing. Example: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/XXXXXXXXXXXXXX -Physical goods are not shipped with purchases made on Steam. If this is a payment fraud investigation, any address entered at the time of purchase will match the billing address of the card. We do track the IP address of where the purchase is made, however, this can be a proxy. -We are unable to provide information that has not been specifically outlined in the Subpoena or Court Order. Please provide the date range you are investigating and outline the account activity you are looking for. For example: billing address, email address, IP address of the purchases/log on, Steam account name or persona etc. If this request involves an EU subscriber: All users of the Steam online service in the territory of the European Union are customers of Valve SARL, a Luxembourg company with registered offices at 26, Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg, Luxembourg. Valve SARL is the controller of their user account data in the sense of Article 2 (d) of EU Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of personal data. Luxembourg data protection law requires that all requests for disclosure of personal data by law enforcement authorities be directed through the Luxembourg state attorney’s office by means of a mutual legal assistance request.

Notes:
As of 10/30/2018, Viber advised that they can only provide data for a maximum of 24 months and they are not able to preserve any data.
In order for Viber to consider providing such information, we must receive a court-ordered warrant or subpoena from legal authorities that include the caller’s phone number and the period of time for which you request the report.
Please note that due to the high cost of processing, requests may be subject to a processing fee based on the time frame from which the records are requested. The fee, payable in advance, is $200 for the first month of data, and $50 for each additional month (or any part thereof), per account. The fee will apply regardless of how much data is found as Viber still incurs fees to process the request.
Our records can be provided for a maximum of 30 months prior and include the following:
The time of the calls
Call duration
Destination numbers
IP addresses
The log will not include message or call content, it will only indicate to which numbers messages were sent and when (Viber does not store message content or record any Viber calls*)
Based on the time frame of the request, the report can take 3-6 weeks to complete due to the immense amount of Viber data that must be processed.
*For information on what is and is not stored in the Viber database, review our privacy policy at: https://www.viber.com/en/privacypolicy.html

Some of Visa’s financial institution clients issue payment cards to their cardholder customers under Visa’s neutral trademark. These financial institutions independently determine the terms and conditions of credit extensions, the number of cards to issue, and the interest rates and fees to charge cardholders, among other things. Visa itself is not involved at the consumer level of payment card transactions: it does not issue cards, service a cardholder’s account, assess cardholder fees, make loans to cardholders, or set interest rates. The cardholder relationships belong exclusively to Visa’s financial institution clients and are managed by them. However, Visa can determine which financial institution issued a specific card by reference to the first six digits of the card number. We can only search our database by card number and not by social security number or person/corporate name. If you are able to furnish us with the first six digits of the Visa card number, we can then direct you to the appropriate financial institution. For issuing bank information, call 24/7: 800-367-8472

VyStar Credit Union, a Florida-chartered financial institution whose field of membership is in Florida and Southeast Georgia, is not subject to the jurisdiction of a State court in California, and consequently compliance with your search warrant risks violating Florida law. We would however be required to respond to a California warrant when ordered by a Florida court through domestication.

As a Swiss company we can only comply to data access requests under condition that this would be in line with the applicable Swiss legal rules, which include the regulations on international legal assistance applicable for Switzerland. We would kindly ask you to follow that route, since we cannot comply with foreign court orders as such.
Our subsidiary in the US and Germany does not have access to user data and therefore can not produce any data in response to an US court order.
Wire is an end-to-end encrypted messenger service. This means data is encrypted on the sender’s device and only decrypted on the recipient’s device. Wire doesn’t have the encryption keys and cannot look into conversations.
This applies to all data shared between users, including text messages, pictures, files, voice messages and calls. Therefore Wire cannot produce any of this data in response to a court order. Wire servers only relay encryption messages and only keep server-side logs up to a maximum of 72 hours. The only potentially personally identifiable user data Wire stores is the profile name and username and a phone number or email address (depending on what users provided). Users wishing to stay anonymous typically sign up using a nickname and an anonymous email address.

Wizz,"Wizz
Online Service: Wizz
Country: France
Notes:
Wizz is a French company and that due to the data privacy statutes that apply to a French company (which include criminal penalties for disregarding those provisions), Wizz is unable to comply with search warrants unless and until they are transmitted in accordance with the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (“MLAT”) between France and the United States, as supplemented and clarified by the subsequent MLAT between the European Union and the United States.
Those treaties require that requests for legal assistance between our two countries be transmitted to and from the respective “Central Authorities” in each nation. According to the Treaty, requests from the United States must be made by “the Attorney General or a person designated by the Attorney General.” See Article 2, Treaty Between the United States of America and France, signed at Paris December 10, 1998 (“The Central Authorities shall communicate directly with one another for the purposes of this Treaty”).
There is no provision in the Treaty that would permit Wizz to respond to a court order transmitted informally through other channels. We would respectfully ask you to contact the United States Department of Justice Office of International Affairs (“OIA”) and seek assistance in making a proper request under the MLAT. If you have not used this process in the past, you might find the following link to be helpful: https://www.justice.gov/criminal-oia/frequently-asked-questions-regarding-evidence-located-abroad.
In the meantime, we would be grateful if you could provide us with any information or elements that would allow our technical team to investigate this topic. The username(s) of the person(s) involved, phone number(s), email(s), extracts of messages or any other helpful elements you can share with us would be helpful.

https://www.womply.com/contact-us/
Please note that Womply is not a lender and does not make loans. For the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Womply provided two services to PPP lenders. First, as a referral agent, Womply marketed the PPP to eligible applicants and then routed those individuals to lenders. Second, Womply acted as a technology service provider for select lenders. Specifically, Womply provided a variety of technology solutions including Fast Lane, which collected and automated PPP application data and supporting information provided by the applicant, such as identification documents, bank account data and tax records. In partnership with other technology providers, Womply also provided a web-based interface used by lenders to review, manage, and underwrite loans.
Additionally, you can email the subpoena to Rob Walley at rwalley@womply.com or Womply’s counsel at Willkie Farr & Gallagher.  Doing so will help ensure more timely production.  Please encrypt the document if it includes Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

“Zelle is a brand name owned by Early Warning Services, LLC and EWS does not disclose information received on Subpoena/Search Warrant/Court Order requests to any named individuals and the requests are kept confidential.”
Information Needed to Run a Search for Zelle Consumer and Transaction Data:
In order to run a search within Early Warning’s systems for Zelle consumer or transaction data,
the subpoena must contain:
(1) Zelle Token: This is the email address or cell phone number of the sender or recipient that is
linked to both their bank account and their Zelle registration; OR
(2) Zelle Transaction ID: This is a 12 digit ID provided by the sending bank to Early Warning
when the transfer is made. The first 3 digits are the abbreviation of the sending bank (WFC for
Wells Fargo or BAC for Bank of America, for example) followed by 9 alphanumeric digits (usually
a mix of letter and numbers although for some banks, such as Chase, it will be numbers only). If
you only have the last nine digits but you know the name of the sending bank, then Early Warning
can infer the abbreviation and run a search. Any request without the first 3 digits or the sending
bank name will be returned as insufficient. Note that some banks refer to a “confirmation number”
or “reference number” that is 10 digits; this is not a Zelle transaction ID and is not searchable in
Early Warning’s systems.
Transaction Recipients: Note that the search results will not provide the bank account numbers,
dates of birth or other personal information of the individuals associated with the transactions, but
they will provide a “Payment Profile ID” for the recipient. The recipient bank provides the
Payment Profile ID to Early Warning and it corresponds to the recipient’s bank account. If Early
Warning is able to locate a Payment Profile ID, you would provide that Payment Profile ID to the
recipient bank to obtain additional information about the recipient.
Transaction Senders: Information is more limited for senders of transactions and Early Warning
must have a sender’s token in order to run a search for responsive information that can lead to their
Payment Profile ID (and then to their bank account, as described above). If a search does return a
Zelle transaction ID for a sender (but we still do not have a sender token), you would provide that
number to the sending bank to obtain additional information about the sender.
If you have any questions about the information in this memo, please contact: subpoena@earlywarning.com
